# max guidelines

This is a set of patches presenting some of what I consider to be the some most important guidelines to program in Max/MSP to keep your patches organized and optimal in terms of CPU comsumption.

This guidelines will help you if you are creating big patches or working as a part of a team of Max.

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding more guidelines and examples.
