# Guidelines and Best Practices for Max Programmers

This is a set of patches presenting some of what I consider to be the some most important guidelines to program in Max/MSP to keep your patches organized and optimal in terms of CPU comsumption.

This guidelines will help you if you are creating big patches or working as a part of a team of Max programmers.

Help this project grow! Feel free to contribute to it by adding more guidelines and examples.
